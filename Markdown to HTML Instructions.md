# How to create XML and HTML #
These instructions only work on a Linux OS.
They apply to all FAPI Markdown specs and not just the **Financial\_API\_WD\_001.md** as indicated. Replace **Financial\_API\_WD\_001.md** with the appropriate filename.


1. Install **xsltproc** package from Linux distribution

2. Install **pandoc2rfc** from [https://github.com/miekg/pandoc2rfc](https://github.com/miekg/pandoc2rfc)

3. In the pandoc2rfc directory, put attached **fapi_template.xml** template file. This file contains the authors, date, and some boilerplate text (Warning, Copyright, Foreword, Introduction sections as XML Note elements) from the markdown file. Edit as necessary.

4. Put **Financial_AP\_WD\_001.md** in pandoc2rfc directory

5. Manually, edit **Financial\_API\_WD_001.md** with the following :
	1. Delete **everything** above the **Scope** section (Warning, Copyright, Foreword, Introduction). These sections have been added to the **fapi\_template.xml** file already.
	2. Delete the section numbers and move the section up 1 level.  The markdown is manually numbered and the "##" is a subsection but we want the XML to start as a main section.

```
#!text

## 1. Scope == > # Scope
## 2. Normative references ==> # Normative references
...
## 5. Read Only API Security Profile ==> # Read Only API Security Profile
### 5.1 Introduction ==> ## Introduction
```
6.Run the following command to generate the XML using pandoc2rfc:

```
#!text

./pandoc2rfc -X -t fapi_template.xml -x transform.xsl Financial_API_WD_001.md
```
7.A **draft.xml** file is generated. This file can be used as input into **xml2rfc** to generate the HTML version.



# fapi_template.xml #
The **fapi_template.xml** contains
```
#!xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE rfc SYSTEM 'rfc2629.dtd' [
<!ENTITY pandocMiddle PUBLIC '' 'Financial_API_WD_001.xml'>

        <note title="Introduction"><t>In many cases, Fintech services such as aggregation services use screen scraping and store user passwords. This model is both brittle and insecure. To cope with the brittleness, it should utilize an API model with structured data and to cope with insecurity, it should utilize a token model such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].  </t><t>Financial API aims to rectify the situation by developing a REST/JSON model protected by OAuth. However, just asking to use OAuth is too vague as there are many implementation choices. OAuth is a framework which can cover wide range of use-cases thus some implementation choices are easy to implement but less secure and some implementation choices are harder to implement but more secure.  Financial services on the internet is a use-case that requires more secure implementation choices. That is, OAuth needs to be profiled to be used in the financial use-cases.  </t><t>This document is a Part 1 of a set of document that specifies Financial API. It provides a profile of OAuth that is suitable to be used in the access of Read Only financial data. An even more secure profile that is suitable for a transactional (i.e., Read/Write) APIs are given in Part 2. Part 3 onwards provides the data schema for specific use-cases.  </t></note>
